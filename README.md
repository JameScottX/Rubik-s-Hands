# Rubik's-Hands


###This is a software system for the robot to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Hand  
Here we use two cameras and a robotic arm to flip the cube to achieve the color face of the cube. The method of Jaap Scherphuis is used to solve the execution step of the Rubik's cube, and the robotic arm is solved by the underlying coordinate orientation transformation.

Some of the code here is superfluous, but it is used by other programs, so it is saved here.
